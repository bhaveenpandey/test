Firewalls are security systems (hardware, software, or both) that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. They act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks (like the internet).

Here are the main **types of firewalls**:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Packet-Filtering Firewall**

* Works at the **network layer**.
* Checks packets against rules (source/destination IP, port number, protocol).
* Very fast, but basic (doesnâ€™t inspect data inside packets).

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Circuit-Level Gateway**

* Works at the **session layer**.
* Verifies that connections (TCP handshakes) are legitimate.
* Does not inspect packet content, only ensures the session is valid.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Stateful Inspection Firewall**

* Monitors the **state of active connections**.
* Tracks the entire session instead of inspecting each packet individually.
* More secure than packet-filtering and circuit-level firewalls.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Proxy Firewall (Application-Level Gateway)**

* Works at the **application layer**.
* Acts as an intermediary between users and the internet.
* Can inspect the actual content of traffic (e.g., HTTP requests).
* Provides strong security but can slow down traffic.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**

* Combines traditional firewall features with:

  * **Deep packet inspection (DPI)**
  * **Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)**
  * **Application awareness**
  * **User identity management**
* More advanced, suitable for modern threats.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Cloud Firewalls (Firewall-as-a-Service, FWaaS)**

* Hosted in the **cloud**, protecting cloud infrastructures.
* Scalable and easy to manage remotely.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Software Firewalls**

* Installed on individual computers/servers.
* Controls traffic for that specific device.
* Example: Windows Firewall.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. **Hardware Firewalls**

* Standalone physical devices placed between the network and the internet.
* Handle large amounts of traffic efficiently.
* Often used in enterprise environments.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to create a **comparison table** (with pros, cons, and use cases) for these firewall types?
